## ðŸ‘‰ Commands

### Protected actions

Some commands have a lock (`ðŸ”’`) on its name, that means that they are protected by a special role, because they can be dangerous in various ways without any supervision. To use them, you need to have a role called `Bot Manager`, which can be generated by a command provided by the bot.
