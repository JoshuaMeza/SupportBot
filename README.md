### What is SupportBot?

SupportBot is a Discord bot specially developed to help you start using Discord as an environment for work or school teams organization. It creates a healthy and safe space for teamworking by letting different groups of people coexist in a single server, but, with private and independent categories managed by roles (only obtainable with an invitation poll made by the team members or by manually adding the role to a user).

SupportBot also provides some interesting features, like the possibility of creating a _school profile_ and filling it as you need. That information can be later requested by you or any of your teammates that share a _team category_ whenever you want. This is pretty useful for assignment front pages, don't you think so?

If you are a teacher, or someone in charge, and you need to be sure that everything is going OK, there is the possibility of generating a _Supervisor_ role. This role has the particularity of make possible the access to all the _team categories_, but not interacting with them.

### Why SupportBot?

This is a completely free tool with some cool features, like:

- Having a registration procedure to save the studentâ€™s information.
- Having the possibility of requesting the registered information of the team members.
- Creating private categories managed by roles for teammate organization.
- Saving important URLs and notes.
- Deleting a specified amount of previous messages.
- A tutorial command.
- Helping commands.
